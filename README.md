# Ideal_Gas_Simulation

This project was completed as part of my 2nd year Physics Degree at Imperial College London.

The user can specify whether the code should be run with or without animation at line 17.

The temperature of the gas can be varied at line 20.

If run with the animation, the code is set up to create balls of three different sizes. The number of balls and types of balls can be varied at lines 330 and 151-153 respectively. The simulation will display frame number, temperature, and pressure of the gas.

If run without the animation, the code creates 100 balls with mass and radius of monoatomic hydrogen atoms. The code is set up to run the simulations which were performed for the lab report. These can be found between lines 341 and 378. It takes a couple of hours to run all of them. If results want to be obtained quicker, then the number of frames specified at lines 349, 357, 369, and 376 can be diminished. For example, if all of them are set to ca. 5 frames then the code will finish running in a couple of minutes.

Lastly, please note that all numbers that correspond to physical quantities are in SI units.
